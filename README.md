# Clicker -  The Discord Bot

Welcome to the Clicker Discord Bot! This bot allows you to play music in voice channels of any Discord server. It utilizes Python modules and APIs to get working which are listed below. I have added features for an enhanced music experience.

## About

With this bot, you can seamlessly play music in voice channels. I hosted this bot on replit.com which is an online integrated development environment which lets us create online projects called Repls.
